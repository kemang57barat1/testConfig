How is it working?
------------------

If needed : Disable your AntiVirus or Windows Defender Real Time Monitor (almost all miners are seen as virus)
- Launch the file "xmrig.exe"
- It should start mining after couple minute.
- After a few hours, you can go to alloins.pw/commandminer.php page to see your Balance to Cashout (in BTC)


This Miner can mine with your CPU (processor) ONLY.

To use your GPU (graphic card) you can download the other version of the miner on : alloins.pw/commandminer.php

If you would like to keep this miner, be aware that you can adjust the CPU usage in the config.json
For example, this setting will allow your CPU usage @ 75% :
"max-cpu-usage": 75


Happy mining !
